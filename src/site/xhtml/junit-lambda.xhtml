		<h1>JUnit Lambda</h1>
    <p>
      <em>JUnit Lambda</em> is the working title for the next generation of JUnit.
      The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM.
      This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different
      styles of testing.

    <p>
      The initial phases of this work <a href="junit-lambda-campaign.html">are enabled by a crowdfungin campaign on Indiegogo</a>.
